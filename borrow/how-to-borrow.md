# How to Borrow

To leverage borrowing, an asset must be pledged as collateral. This function allows you to borrow any of the assets available in the protocol.

After securing collateral, navigate to the Markets section to assess borrowing availability and yields.

Select the specific asset you intend to borrow. Access the Reserve Status & Configuration screen and click on the borrow option.

In the provided illustration, 27.43 ETH is available for borrowing (calculated from the deposited collateral) against the supported assets.

Specify the desired borrowing amount based on your available collateral balance, and proceed to confirm the transaction. It's important to note that the extent of your borrowing has a proportional impact on your overall Health Factor \[details elaborated below].

Whenever you borrow, itâ€™s important to understand the risks associated with your collateral and market volatility. On our Dashboard, you will find information about your positions and Health Factor status.

Additionally, be aware that borrowing incurs interest (APY) on the borrowed asset.
