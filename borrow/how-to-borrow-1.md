# How to Take Out a Loan

To leverage borrowing, an asset must be pledged as collateral. This function allows you to borrow any of the assets available in the protocol.

**1.- Deposit Collateral**\
Select the asset, approve, and sign.

**2.- Check Your Borrowing Capacity**\
In _Markets_ you’ll see the maximum LTV and available liquidity.

The dashboard displays accrued interest, HF, and liquidation alerts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Remember:** Maximum LTV is dynamic and depends on the asset’s volatility.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Example: If USDC has an 80 % LTV, every 100 USDC of collateral lets you borrow up to 80 USDC.
{% endhint %}

Additionally, be aware that borrowing incurs interest (APY) on the borrowed asset.
