# Copy of Key Features of PrimeFi

* PrimeFi is committed to cutting-edge technology. In this way, and through innovation to solve the existing problem of intercommunication between networks, we have adopted LayerZero technology:

1. This technology allows you to deposit an asset on one network and borrow another asset on a different network without any risk. All from within our protocol.
2. PRFI, as an OFT token, enables seamless bridging across all integrated networks on PrimeFi through our interface, without any bridge risk, thanks to Stargate-LayerZero technology.

* PrimeFi stands out for integrating NFTs into the lending and borrowing framework. This unique feature and an NFT marketplace allows for novel lending and borrowing opportunities involving NFTs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The integration of NFTs will take place after the main features of the protocol are launched on Mainnet.

* Safeguard Your Investments:&#x20;

All our loans are overcollateralized, making your loans safer. However, it's crucial to maintain your Health Factor above 1 as a safety net to prevent your loan from being liquidated.

* Institutional-Grade Security:&#x20;

Through continuous audits, we ensure our platform maintains ironclad security to protect our users.

* Inclusive Access:&#x20;

Our platform and community are packed with fun, accessible ways to learn about DeFi, ensuring you have the knowledge you need.
