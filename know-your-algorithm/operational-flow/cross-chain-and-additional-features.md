#### Cross-Chain and Additional Features

PrimeFi is designed with multi-chain support via LayerZero, which means liquidity and rewards can operate across different networks. The **RewardDistributionController** (RDC) works in tandem with the ChefIncentivesController to synchronize reward accounting on the main chain and sidechains. Essentially, local Chef contracts handle per-chain accrual, and the RDC aggregates information like total supply per chain and ensures that users moving assets between chains get consistent rewards. It uses LayerZero messaging (OApp) to communicate actions across chains and maintain a global view of protocol usage. For users, this complexity is behind the scenes â€“ they simply supply, borrow, and earn rewards on their chain of choice. The PrimeFi architecture also includes features like the **Looper** (an automation tool that can, for example, recycle borrowed WETH into another product called FLIK in a single step) and integrations with the **Prime Numbers NFT** ecosystem as discussed. These components expand the utility of the core lending algorithm by creating synergy between lending and other DeFi activities (yield farming, NFT staking, etc.), while the underlying algorithm remains grounded in well-audited Aave logic.
