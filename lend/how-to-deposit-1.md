# Copy of How to Deposit?

In the **Markets** tab, under the **Stats Overview** section, you’ll find the **BSC-T Assets** section. Here, you can select an asset from your preference and start interacting with it.

Let’s say you’ve chosen USDT. The initial setup will display the option to deposit.

Enter the amount of USDT you want to deposit and press **Continue**.

Next, you’ll see a prompt that says **“Approve”**. If you haven’t used this protocol before, you’ll need to approve the token, granting the protocol permission to manage this asset within your wallet. Click **“Approve”** — this is a simple signing transaction.

Now, wait for the approval to complete. Once it’s done, press **“Deposit”** and accept the subsequent transaction to deposit your USDT into the protocol. In return, you’ll receive an p\_Token\_ that tracks the interest you earn as a _lender_.
