# How to Deposit?

In the **Markets** tab, under the **Stats Overview** section, you’ll find the **Base Network Assets** section. Here, you can select an asset from your preference and start interacting with it.

Let’s say you’ve chosen USDC. The initial setup will display the option to deposit.

Enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit and press **Deposit USDC**.

Next, you’ll see a prompt that says **“Approve”**. If you haven’t used this protocol before, you’ll need to approve the token, granting the protocol permission to manage this asset within your wallet. Click **“Approve”,** this is a simple signing transaction.

Now, wait for the approval to complete. Once it’s done, press **“Confirm Deposit”** and accept the subsequent transaction to deposit your USDC into the protocol. In return, you’ll receive an p\_Token\_ that tracks the interest you earn as a _lender_.
