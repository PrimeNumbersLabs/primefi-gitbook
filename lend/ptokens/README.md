# pTokens

### pTokens: Interest-Bearing Deposit Tokens

**pTokens** (interest-bearing tokens) are minted when users **deposit assets** into the protocol.\
They act both as deposit receipts and as yield-accruing instruments.

* **Primary function:** represent the user‚Äôs share of the liquidity pool.
* **Interest accrual:** the value of each pToken increases relative to its underlying asset as the pool generates yield.
* **Example:** when depositing USDC, the user receives `pUSDC`. These tokens can later be redeemed for the original deposit plus accrued interest.
* **User role:** pTokens serve as the user‚Äôs ‚Äúproof of deposit‚Äù and guarantee the right to reclaim funds with interest.

üëâ In short: **pTokens represent the creditor (lender) side of the protocol.**

| **Symbol format**     | `p<ASSET>`, e.g. `pWETH`, `pUSDC`                                                                                                                                                |
| **Lifecycle**         | <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Minted</strong> when you supply the underlying asset.</p><p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Burned</strong> when you withdraw or when your collateral is liquidated.</p>                  |
| **Valuation**         | Maintains a **1:1 peg** to the underlying asset. Your pToken balance grows over time as interest accrues.                                                                        |
| **Interest accrual**  | Each reserve has a _liquidity index_. When the index increases, your pToken balance is scaled up proportionally, no action required.                                             |
| **Wallet visibility** | pTokens are standard ERC-20 tokens and appear in most wallets; you may need to add the contract address manually.                                                                |
| **Redeeming**         | Navigate to **Dashboard ‚Üí Deposits ‚Üí Withdraw** to convert pTokens back to the original asset. The protocol burns the pTokens and transfers the corresponding underlying amount. |
