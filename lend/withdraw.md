# Withdraw

This functionality is the reverse of making a deposit. To use it, follow the same process but through the section labelled **“Withdraw”**.

Select the desired amount and submit the transaction.

Ensure there is sufficient available liquidity in the protocol to complete the withdrawal. If not, you’ll need to wait for more liquidity to be provided by depositors or for borrowers to repay their loans before you can withdraw the desired amount.

You can withdraw your collateralized assets as long as:

* The assets are not currently being used to secure any active loans.
* The withdrawal does not trigger a liquidation of your loans.

The platform will always notify you if any of your actions jeopardize your Health Factor. It is not possible to withdraw deposits if doing so would negatively impact your Health Factor due to your loans.
