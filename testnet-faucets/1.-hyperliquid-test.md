# 1.-Hyperliquid Test

At PrimeFi, we have developed a custom faucet for you to obtain HYPE tokens to pay for fees when making transactions on our testnet.

It's as simple as clicking on the bar that represents the HYPE token once you have connected your wallet to the platform.:

It is limited to 0.01 HYPE tokens per user. Enough to test all the features.
