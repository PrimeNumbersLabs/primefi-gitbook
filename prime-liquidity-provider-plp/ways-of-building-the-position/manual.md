# Manual

* **How it works**

To manually create a position in the pLP, we need to go to the PRFI/native token pool on the network. We will add a position with a specific composition and receive our LP token, which will represent that position.

This LP token can be locked through the PrimeFi interface for different periods of time.

_Note: This feature is only available on Mainnet._

* **Lock Length**

We can lock the position for different periods of time:\
1, 3, 6, or 12 months.

The longer the lock period, the greater the rewards we will receive from the protocol.
