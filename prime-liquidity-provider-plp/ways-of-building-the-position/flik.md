# Flik Positions

## **How it Works**

Imagine you have HYPE and want to enter the PRFI-HYPE pool. The traditional process for doing so is quite cumbersome.

Initially, you need to provide PRFI and HYPE in the correct ratios, which requires four separate transactions.

_**Fliking**_ simplifies this process by allowing you to complete it with a single click.

When you use _**Flik**_ with one of these assets, the system automatically converts it to HYPE behind the scenes. This HYPE is then combined with PRFI to create and lock the LP.

This feature is designed to give you increased flexibility with the protocol, making it easier and more efficient to earn and lock LP.

## **Methods for Building it**

You can select between 2 _Flik_ sources.

### **1.-Wallet**

PrimeFi enables you to _Flik_ using supported assets from your wallet.

2.-Borrow

Alternatively, if you have deposited collateral, you can borrow directly from the protocol.

Be mindful of your Health Factor and the risk of liquidation before borrowing. Fliking will never lower your Health Factor below 1.1.

The lock periods function the same way as in the manual pLP.
