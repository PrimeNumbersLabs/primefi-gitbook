# Sustaining Eligibility Status

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep in mind: You must always maintain a minimum 5% ratio between the total value of your deposit and the value of your pLP to stay eligible!
{% endhint %}

Being a risk asset, pricing volatility can cause users to fluctuate in and out of eligibility.

Example:

* Boris holds $5 worth of pLP on Base (PRFI/ETH) and has $100 in USDT deposits, meeting the 5% requirement (eligible for emissions).
* When the price of ETH decreases by 5%, the value of pLP falls below $5. Consequently, Boris falls below the 5% threshold required to earn emissions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The protocol must consistently assess the eligibility status to ascertain which users are included and which are excluded.
{% endhint %}

Once eligible, banners at the top of each page will display "Emissions active."

Should you lose eligibility, a notification reading "boost inactive" will be visible at the top of each page. It will also indicate the amount of pLP needed to restore eligibility.

Click "Flik into pLP" and follow the prompts to resume receiving $PRFI emissions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To enhance the chances of staying eligible for PRFI emissions, money market participants may want to maintain a buffer zone above the 5% threshold to accommodate potential volatility.
{% endhint %}

### Example:

Bob deposits $1,000 USDT in the money market and must lock a minimum of $50 of pLP to qualify for PRFI emissions.

Choosing to stay cautious amid potential volatility, Bob opts to lock $60 in pLP (1% above the threshold) to ensure he maintains eligibility status.

Furthermore, users can enhance their chances of preserving eligibility status by enabling auto-compound and auto-relock features from the Manage PrimeFi page.
