#### Maximum Lock APR:

This is determined as the highest APR achievable when pLP is locked for a one-year period.

**Formula:**

`1-month lock APR * 1-year lock multiplier (25x)`

#### 1-Month Locking APR:

This represents the current APR for locking your pLP tokens for a one-month period.

**Formula:**

`(Total 1 Month Lockers’ Share of Annualized Protocol Fees) / (Total 1 Month Lockers’ Share of pLP Pool Size)`

#### 1 Month Locker Share of Protocol Fees:

**Formula:**

`(1 Month Locker Share of Protocol Power) / (Total Protocol Locking Power)`

#### Total Protocol Locking Power:

This is the sum of all lockers’ shares, each adjusted by its respective multiplier.

```
= (1 Month Lockers' Share of pLP Pool Size * 1 Month Locker Multiplier (1x)) 
+ (3 Month Lockers’ Share of pLP Pool Size * 3 Month Locker Multiplier (4x))
+ (6 Month Lockers’ Share of pLP Pool Size * 6 Month Lockers’ Multiplier (10x))
+ (12 Month Lockers' Share of pLP Pool Size * 12 Month Locker Multiplier (25x))
```
