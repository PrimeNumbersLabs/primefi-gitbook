Your Locked pLP: The variable value of pLP influenced by volatility in the underlying tokens - PRFI & HYPE or PRFI & ETH.

{% hint style="success" %}
pLP USD Value = (TWAP(PRFI, 1 hr) \* prfiInLp) + (hypePrice \* hypeInLp) / LP Supply
{% endhint %}

**pLP Locked (global):** The cumulative value of all pLP locked on the chosen blockchain.

**Daily platform fees (global):** The total platform fees fluctuate daily, influenced by borrowing interest, liquidations, and flash loan fees generated by the protocol over a rolling 24-hour period. Daily platform fees are evenly distributed over seven days.

**Your share:** The percentage of global daily platform fees that belongs to you, determined by your locked dLP in proportion to the total size of globally locked pLP.

Calculation: (User share of pLP \* user avg. pLP Multiplier) / (Total Protocol pLP \* Global Protocol avg. multiplier)

The average multiplier is determined by your selected lock length each time you perform a lock/relock or flik/auto-compound into pLP.

Calculation Example for User 1:

* Total: 2 pLP locked / 13x Avg. Multiplier
* 1 pLP Locked for 1 year (25x multiplier)
* 1 pLP Locked for 1 month (1x multiplier)

**Total Annual Platform Fees:** The projected protocol fees a user is expected to receive over 365 days, based on an extrapolated 24-hour sample of Global Protocol Fees.

Calculation: (User Daily Protocol Fees \* 365)

**Your Present Lock APR:**

* Definition: User-specific Lock APR determined by the average multiplier.

Calculation: (Global 1-month Locking APR \* User Avg Multiplier)
