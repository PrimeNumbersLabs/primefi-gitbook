# Copy of Vesting Emissions

{% hint style="info" %}
Kindly be aware that this choice is accessible exclusively to users who fulfill the pLP eligibility requirements.
{% endhint %}

### Overview

For participants in PrimeFi's money markets, opting for vesting PRFI presents a distinctive opportunity to leverage collective market engagement. By depositing assets and attaining pLP eligibility, users not only earn an APY% yield on their assets but also acquire additional yields through PRFI emissions.

The vesting of PRFI follows a structured approach, encompassing a linearly decreasing penalty for early withdrawal, commencing at 90% and gradually reducing to 25% over a 90-day period. This structure encourages users to commit to the entire vesting duration, ensuring they can fully reap the benefits of the earned PRFI, reflecting their contribution to the platform's overall utility and success.

### Initiating PRFI Vesting

To fully vest PRFI and unlock its full value, a 90-day maturation period is required.

1. **Starting the Vesting Process:** Go to the 'Manage' page and locate the 'Vesting Overview' section.
2. **Eligibility:** If you haven't met the pLP requirements, the 'Start vesting' button will be disabled.
3. **Activation:** Eligible users can click 'Start vesting' and confirm the transaction in their wallet.

After activation, the 'Vesting Overview' panel provides diverse management functions for monitoring and overseeing your vesting process.

Flik Vesting PRFI into pLP

Once PRFI is in the vesting phase, initiate fliking into locked pLP without incurring an exit penalty to start receiving platform revenue and qualify for PRFI emissions from lending and borrowing.

Within the "currently vesting" section, opt for "Flik into pLP."

The Flik with vesting PrimeFi modal will appear:

Please be aware that the PRFI and ETH/BNB input fields will be automatically populated. Fliking with vesting PRFI can only be performed for the entire vesting amount. Therefore, the ETH/BNB calculation (borrowed from the money market or paired from your wallet) is automated based on the required ratio to form the liquidity token.

After clicking continue, choose the lock duration and corresponding multiplier, then proceed by clicking continue. Verify that the Fliking information is accurate and click "Flik into pLP" to confirm the necessary transactions in your wallet.

### Early Exit

Exiting early incurs a penalty to receive PRFI immediately. Vests can be exited collectively for the penalty displayed under the "exit early" button below.

Alternatively, exit individual vests with their respective penalty amounts by clicking the right arrow below each vest you wish to exit.

#### Additional Notes

* Exiting a vest early will result in a 25-90% penalty based on a linear schedule of elapsed time.
* The penalty paid is distributed at a ratio of 90% to the PrimeFi Treasury, while the other 10% will be burned.
* Initiating an "Exit Early" transaction from the "Currently vesting" panel will exit all separate vesting periods, with applicable penalties applied.
* Alternatively, you may choose to "exit early" from individual vests using the menu on the vesting panel.
* Initiating a "Flik into pLP" transaction will hop into all separate vesting periods.
